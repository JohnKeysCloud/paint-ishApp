<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> titled this project "Etch-a-Sketch"; However, considering the functionality desired, I prefer to call it Sketch. It is most useful, in my opinion, for drawing pixelated sprites ðŸ‘¾. 
I designed and programmed the app using using vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

### Notes
I wanted to keep the UX/UI clean and straightforward with a minimal, yet modern aesthetic. My favorite part of authoring this project was creating the animated labels for the color inputs. Styling color inputs on their own in vanilla code isn't the most fun, so I figured I'd not only do that but also have the labels circle around the inputâ€¦ not only for a cleaner look, but also to ensure that the settings card is as concise as possible without forsaking application features seen in other submissions for this particular project (see the code snippet below for a peek under the hood ðŸ‘€). An honorable mention though, would be the shade toggle button design. I added depth to the text within the button on click, giving said text a shaded look when the toggle is enabled. Cool stuffâ€¦

Anywho, I will probably end up using the app for my own pixel art ðŸ˜…ðŸ’­.

Oh! The **Zima** theme color palette was inspired by the insanely creative, animated Netflix series, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80174608">Love, Death & Robots</a> episode <a href="https://lovedeathrobots.fandom.com/wiki/Zima_Blue" target="_blank">Zima Blue</a>.

Enjoy! ^_^

## Tools
* VS Code
* Git & Github
* HTML5
* CSS3 
* JavaScript ES6
* Terminal

## Summary
* **CSS Grid** is used to generate/regenerate the canvas in a live fashion (without reloading the page); However, it does result in the loss of the current sessions art (â€¦for which I've included a warning in the help section). 
* Used **CSS Variables** with JavaScript for most of the toggling features (i.e. themes and canvas sizing).
* Used HTML5 **semantic elements** for better readability, structure & accessibility.
* Used **Git** & **GitHub** for source control/project management. 
* **Cross tested** design and functionality on desktop & mobile browsers.
