<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> called this an etch-a-sketchâ€¦ I disagree! It's more 'paintish' ðŸ™ƒ. I am currently designing and programming it using vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript forâ€¦ <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>.

### Notes

I'm currently this! The color palette is inspired by the insanely creative, animated Netflix series: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80174608">Love, Death & Robot</a>â€¦ specifically the episode <a href="https://lovedeathrobots.fandom.com/wiki/Zima_Blue" target="_blank">Zima Blue</a>.

Included is the initial logic and the minimally designed interface. I think I will keep it this way throughout the project.
